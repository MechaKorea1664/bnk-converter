This application converts .bnk to different audio formats (.wav, .mp3, .ogg, .flac, .m4a) using bnkextr.exe and vgmstream-cli.exe.

use is simple: put the .exe (either from release or one you personally made yourself from the files) into a directory with a "input" folder that contains one or more .bnk files to process. The output will be stored in a automatically generated "output" folder, splitting the output for each .bnk file in a separate folder within.

this project would not be possible without bnkextr and vgmstream-cli. Here are links to the respective respositories:

vgmstream-cli: https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream
